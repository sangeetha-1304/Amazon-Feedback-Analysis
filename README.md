# Amazon-Feedback-Analysis
# Project

## Objective
Uncover the drivers of customer sentiment and engagement in Amazon product reviews to inform product development and marketing strategies.

## Data Cleaning
Standardized column names, parsed review dates, handled missing values in text and recommendation flags, and engineered features such as review length and sentiment polarity.

## Data Analysis
Explored distributions of ratings and recommendation flags, identified top brands and categories by sentiment, examined the relationship between review length, helpfulness votes, and ratings.

## Data Visualization
Employed bar charts for rating counts, word clouds for positive vs. negative reviews, scatter plots of helpful votes vs. review length, and heatmaps of sentiment across brands.

## Insights
High ratings (4–5 stars) dominate but negative reviews contain recurring product-specific complaints; longer reviews tend to garner more helpful votes; certain brands/categories show consistently higher sentiment.

## Deliverable 

A thoroughly documented Jupyter Notebook with all code and outputs, plus concise slide deck summarizing actionable findings and recommendations.
